# DragonFly

## Installation

Again, it's all right there.
Download the iso from https://www.dragonflybsd.org/download/, start it. Log in as `installer`.
For simplicity's sake, I am using BIOS boot. All the defaults look very reasonable, so just enter through the installation process.

## Setup

Install all required packages, everything should work out of the box.
