# (Pure-) Darwin

Wow. Lessons learned. Never never never never ever support macos.

From what I can tell, the latest publicly available version of any macos-type os is PureDarwin.

[Here is a download from 2012.](https://sourceforge.net/projects/puredarwin/files/2012/)

Cloning and building from source on Linux did not work for me. (https://github.com/PureDarwin/PureDarwin/issues/65)

GitHub Actions also has an macos runner, I forked PureDarwin to build the thing for me: https://github.com/scrouthtv/PureDarwin/runs/1906173001. Let's see how that turns out.
